            <p>Parrots are a diverse group of birds belonging to the order Psittaciformes, which includes more than 400 species. Known for their bright plumage, strong curved beaks, and high intelligence, parrots are among the most recognizable and beloved birds worldwide.</p>
            
            <p>Parrots are a diverse and colorful group of birds belonging to the order Psittaciformes, which includes around 400 species categorized into three main families: Psittacidae (true parrots), Cacatuidae (cockatoos), and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). These birds are widely recognized for their vibrant plumage, curved beaks, zygodactyl feet (two toes facing forward and two backward), and exceptional intelligence.</p>
            
            <p>True parrots, the largest group, include popular species such as the African Grey Parrot, known for its advanced talking ability and cognitive skills, as well as Amazon parrots, conures, macaws, and budgerigars (budgies), which are commonly kept as pets due to their social and playful nature.</p>
            
            <p>Cockatoos, which are primarily native to Australia and surrounding islands, are distinguished by their expressive crest feathers and affectionate behavior. Some well-known cockatoos include the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, the Umbrella Cockatoo, and the Galah, also known as the Rose-breasted Cockatoo.</p>
            
            <p>The third group, the New Zealand parrots, is much smaller and includes rare and unique species such as the Kea, an intelligent alpine parrot known for its curiosity; the Kākāpō, a critically endangered, flightless, nocturnal parrot; and the forest-dwelling Kākā.</p>
            
            <p>Parrots are native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including South America, Central America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Oceania. They typically inhabit rainforests, savannas, and woodland areas. Their diet consists primarily of seeds, nuts, fruits, and nectar, and they use their strong, curved beaks to crack open hard shells and forage for food.</p>
            
            <p>Parrots are also notable for their strong social structures and ability to mimic human speech and sounds, which has contributed to their popularity in the pet trade. Unfortunately, many parrot species face serious threats in the wild due to habitat loss, deforestation, and illegal wildlife trade. Conservation efforts are being made globally to protect these remarkable birds, including habitat preservation, breeding programs, and laws against poaching.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, parrots are not only visually stunning but also among the most intelligent and socially complex bird species in the world.</p>
